# aah framework Configuration

The configuration syntax is used by aah framework is `forge` developed by [@brettlangdon](https://github.com/brettlangdon") very similar to HOCON syntax. Enhanced by the author of aah framework [@jeevatkm](https://github.com/jeevatkm). Syntax applies to `aah.conf`, `routes.conf`, `security.conf`, `i18n` message files and `aah.project` file.

## Comments

  * The line starts with `#` considered as comment.
  * You can have same line comment after `;`. For e.g: ` identifier = "value"; # comment here`

## Braces

  * Root doesn't start with curly braces.
  * Section must have curly braces - values are enclosed with opening and closing brace.  

## Supported value types

  * `String` - must be quoted string
  * `Integer` - positive and negative value supported

## Key-value and separator

  * The `=` character used to separate keys from values.
  * The key can have `underscore` in it.

## Includes

An include statement tells the config parser to include the contents of another config file where the include statement is defined. Includes are in the format `include "<pattern>"`. The `<pattern>` can be any glob like pattern which is compatible with [path.filepath.Match](http://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Match). It can be absolute path or relative path to `config` directory.

## Environment Variables

An environment is a way to pull in environment variables into your config. Environment variables are identifiers which start with a dollar sign (For example: `$PATH`). Environment variables are always represented as strings and are evaluated at parse time. Adapted to supported value type.

## Substitutions/Reference

Substitutions/Reference are a way of referring to other parts of the configuration into another identifier.

  * **Global Reference** - An identifier which may contain periods, the references are resolved from the global section. For example: `global_value`, `section.sub_section.value`.
  * **Local Reference** - An identifier which main contain periods which starts with a period, the references are resolved from the settings current section. For example: `.value`, `.sub_section.value`.
