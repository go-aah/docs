# aah Application Configuration

The configuration syntax is used by aah framework is very similar to HOCON syntax. To learn more about **[configuration syntax](configuration.html)**.

aah configuration structure is very flexible it is called as `aah.conf`. You can override every config value in the environment profiles also external config file.

You can add your custom config values into app config. Also it can be overridden in the environment profiles.

Reference to [Routes Config](routes-config.html), [Security Config](security-config.html), [Log Config](log-config.html).

cache_dir = "/path/to/store/cache/certs"
```

---

## Section: request { ... }
Request configuration values.

```

### Section: request.id { ... }
aah framework encourages to have unique `Request Id` for each incoming request, it is helpful for traceability. If request already has `X-Request-Id` HTTP header then it does not generate one.

Global Unique Identifier (GUID) generate implementation is based on [Mango DB ObjectId algorithm](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/).

* 4-byte value representing the seconds since the Unix epoch,
* 3-byte machine identifier,
* 2-byte process id, and
* 3-byte counter, starting with a random value.

### request.id.enable

Default value is `true`.
```cfg
enable = true
```

### request.id.header
HTTP header name for generated Request ID. If request already has HTTP header then it does not generate one.

Default value is `X-Request-Id`.
```cfg
header = "X-Request-Id"
```

### Section: request.content_negotiation { ... }
<span class="badge lb-sm">Since v0.8</span> Content negotiation is used to validate what is being `offered` and `accepted` by server in-terms of request and response. Also known as `Content-Type` restrictions.

### request.content_negotiation.enable
To enable/disable Content Negotiation for your application.

Default value is `false`.
```cfg
enable = true
```

### request.content_negotiation.accepted
Accepted - `Content-Type` HTTP header [RFC2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.4.16).

<u>For example:</u> Client sends `Content-Type` header as `application/xml`. However server only supports JSON payload as request body. Then server responds with `415 Unsupported Media Type`.

Default value is empty list and disabled.
```cfg
accepted = ["application/json", "text/json"]
```

### request.content_negotiation.offered
Offered - `Accept` HTTP header [RFC2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.4.7).

<u>For example:</u> Client sends Accept header as `application/xml`. However server only supports serving JSON i.e. `application/json`. Then server responds with `406 Not Acceptable`.

Default value is empty list and disabled.
```cfg
offered = ["application/json", "text/json"]
```

## Section: request.auto_bind { ... }
Auto Bind configuration used to bind request parameters to controller action parameters.

### request.auto_bind.priority
Priority is used to select the bind source priority.
```cfg
P -> Path Parameter
F -> Form Parameter
Q -> Query Parameter
```

<u>For example:</u> Let's say you have a controller action named `OrderInfo` and its has parameter called `orderId`. So framework tries to parse and bind based on the priority. The `orderId` present in `Path` and `Form`, framework parse and binds the value from `Path`.

Typically recommended to have unique names in the request parameter though :) If value is not found then it returns with default Go zero value.

Default value is `PFQ`.
```cfg
priority = "PFQ"
```

### request.auto_bind.tag_name
Tag Name is used for bind values to struct exported fields.

Default value is `bind`.
```cfg
tag_name = "bind"
```

Default value is `en`.
```cfg
default = "en"
```

### Section: i18n.param_name { ... }
Overriding Request Locale `Accept-Language` header value via URL Path parameter or URL Query parameter.

### i18n.param_name.path

Any parse error result in 400 Bad Request.

### format.time
```cfg
time = [
  "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00",

## Section: render { ... }

### render.default

  * Based on URL file extension, supported `.html`, `.htm`, `.json`, `.js`, `.xml` and `.txt`
  * Request Accept Header - Most Qualified one as per [RFC7321](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3)
  * Config `render.default` value supported types are `html`, `json`, `xml` and `text`
  * Finally aah framework uses `http.DetectContentType` method
